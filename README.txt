[Intermediate Code]
Our intermediate code is written using function calls that reads the parse tree generated by ANTLR. The intermediate code is basically a .class file for Java that we manually write using a stack, assembly-like load statements, and storing values into addresses etc. An example can be found by running the method "compile(ANTLRInputStream input)".

[Additional Features]
1. Functions:
	We implemented functions as a blueprint for if-then-else statements and decided to keep the feature. Functions do not accept arguments as of now.
2. Scope:
	To have multiple variables within/outside of functions, we implemented scope so this can be allowed.
