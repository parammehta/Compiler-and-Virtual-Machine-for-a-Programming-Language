**[SystemBuild]**
The compiler and the runtime are built on Linux.
antlr.jar used for Lexical Analysis and jasmin.jar used for creating .class files.
Runtime Environment is Java Virtual Machine and runs directly from Eclipse by clicking on run under Main.java.
You can run the project on Windows, Mac or Linux using following instructions.

**[Intermediate Code]**
Our intermediate code is written using function calls that reads the parse tree generated by ANTLR. The intermediate code is basically a .class file for Java that we manually write using a stack, assembly-like load statements, and storing values into addresses etc. An example can be found by running the method "compile(ANTLRInputStream input)". While running the Main.java file, press 1 for generating intermediate code for your input code.

**[Additional Features]**
1. Functions:
	We implemented functions as a blueprint for if-then-else statements and decided to keep the feature. Functions do not accept arguments as of now.
2. Scope:
	To have multiple variables within/outside of functions, we implemented scope so this can be allowed.
	
**[Running from command line/terminal]**

To run, please execute the following commands and the <program>.apla file should also be at the same level as .jar file.

$ java -jar SER502Team31.jar <program_name>.apla
